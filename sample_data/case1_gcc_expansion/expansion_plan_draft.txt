GCC EXPANSION – DRAFT (internal, not for distribution)

Objective
Expand residential into GCC. 3–5 year horizon. Primary: KSA (Riyadh, Jeddah), UAE (Dubai, Abu Dhabi). Secondary later: Qatar, Kuwait if we get clarity and right partners.

Who we’re building for
- Upper-mid families: 2–4 bed, integrated communities (schools, retail, healthcare)
- Young professionals (local + expat): 1–2 bed, well-connected urban
- Some HNW: branded residences, prime locations

Phasing (high level)
Phase 1 (Y1–2): Beachhead. Riyadh + Dubai. 1–2 pilots per city, ~500–800 units each. Need local JV/partner. Get project teams in place, nail permitting.
Phase 2 (Y3–5): Scale. Add Jeddah, Abu Dhabi. Maybe Doha once post–World Cup dust settles. Introduce branded + mixed-use.

Financials (illustrative – not approved)
- ASP: Riyadh 2–2.4k USD/sqm, Dubai 3–3.5k (our segment)
- Gross margin target 25–30%
- Phase 1 equity: order of 200–250M USD (assume 30–35% equity)
- Target project IRR 15–18% (stable macro)

Enablers
- Strong local partners (land, govt relations)
- Banks with mortgage products for our customer segment
- Repeatable design, central PM and procurement
- Brand + digital GTM, show units in key cities

Risks / mitigants
- Regulatory delays → pick partners with track record, engage regulators early
- Demand shock (oil, macro) → phase launches, flexible pricing, diversify cities
- Execution in new markets → start small, scale after we prove it; invest in local leadership
