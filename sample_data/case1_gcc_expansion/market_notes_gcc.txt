GCC RESIDENTIAL – DESK NOTES (from various sources, not cleaned up)

Saudi:
- Vision 2030 = big push away from oil, giga projects (NEOM, Red Sea, etc.)
- Riyadh + Jeddah = housing shortage, govt wants homeownership up (target ~70%)
- Young pop, urbanising. Regulatory changes ongoing (land, foreign ownership, mortgages)
- Price range we’re looking at: ballpark 2100–2400 USD/sqm mid to upper-mid (Riyadh). Jeddah a bit lower.

UAE:
- Dubai/Abu Dhabi = mature markets, off-plan still strong
- Long-term visas, property-linked residency = more expats buying
- Our segment: 3200–3500 USD/sqm Dubai (excl ultra-prime). Abu Dhabi similar, more govt/institutional demand.
- Past cycles: Dubai had corrections, oversupply risk in some segments.

Qatar / Kuwait / Bahrain / Oman:
- Smaller, affluent. Demand concentrated in capitals (Doha, Kuwait City, etc.)
- Lots of expat workforce, regulatory varies. We’re not prioritising for phase 1.

Risks (need to cover in any deck):
- Oil price → govt spending → sentiment
- Regulatory uncertainty by country
- Oversupply / price correction (e.g. Dubai 10–15% down in a stress scenario?)

Implication for us:
- Focus KSA + UAE first. Riyadh, Jeddah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi. Be selective on city and segment (mid to upper-mid, young professionals + families, some HNW).
- Local JVs / partners essential. Phased entry, learn regulation and market before scaling.
