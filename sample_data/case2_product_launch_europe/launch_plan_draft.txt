EUROPE GO-TO-MARKET – DRAFT (confidential)

Objective
Formal launch in Europe in Q2. First wave: UK, DACH (DE/AT/CH), France. Establish presence, pipeline, and 3+ reference customers per region. Set up for scale in H2.

Target segments
- Enterprise: 1k+ employees, security and compliance-heavy. Primary in DACH and UK.
- Mid-market: 250–1k. Focus in UK and France for faster cycles. Land with core product, expand with add-ons.

GTM elements
- Events: London (C-level invite), Munich, Paris. Plus 3–4 webinars. All supported by paid + organic.
- Sales: 2 AEs dedicated Europe (1 UK, 1 DACH/France). SDR support shared with US until we prove pipeline.
- Partnerships: In discussion with 2 SI’s in UK, 1 in DACH. Not in scope for launch day but Q3.
- Pricing: EUR list. Local contracts. Discount authority per playbook (max 25% off list for first year).

Metrics we’re committing to (internal)
- Pipeline: €2.5M by end Q2 (qualified). Currently ~€1.8M – gap to close.
- New logos: 12+ in first wave markets (UK 5, DACH 4, France 3).
- References: 3 per region, case study or quote. One marquee name in UK or DACH.
- Revenue: €400K ARR from Europe by end Q2 (stretch €500K). Finance has this in plan.

Risks
- Pipeline coverage thin. Dependent on marketing and SDR. One major UK deal slipped – need to replace.
- Longer sales cycles in DACH. May not hit logo count if we don’t accelerate in next 6 weeks.
- Compliance / legal: France entity and contracting still in progress. Could delay some French deals.

Next steps before exec review
- Finalise event dates and invite list. Confirm PR agency for UK/DACH.
- Update pipeline report and bridge to revenue. Prepare “what if we miss” scenario for finance.
